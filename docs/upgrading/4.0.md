title: Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x
---

<p class="message-notice">This is the documentation for the upcoming <code>version 4.0</code>. This is a work in progress.</p>

# Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x

`League\Period 4.0` is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will help you migrate from a 3.x version to 4.0. It will only explain backward compatibility breaks, it will not present the new features ([read the documentation for that](/4.0/)).

## Installation

If you are using composer then you should update the require section of your `composer.json` file.

~~~
composer require league/period:^4.0
~~~

This will edit (or create) your `composer.json` file.

## PHP version requirement

`League\Period 4.0` requires a PHP version greater or equal than 7.1.0 (was previously 5.5.9).

<p class="message-warning">The library is not tested on <code>HHVM</code></p>
